# stickers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dlapets/stickers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dlapets/stickers)

This is a tool to help you cut letters out of the useless stickers they give
you at meetups and conferences so you can use them to craft beautiful poetry
for the whole world to appreciate. Scissors not included.

If you've never seen scissors in your life or are unwilling to become a new
Lermontov, don't worry, you can also use this tool to win at Words With
Friends.
