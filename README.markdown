# stickers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dlapets/stickers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dlapets/stickers)

This is a tool to help you cut letters out of the useless stickers they give
you at meetups and conferences and to make useful phrases with them. Scissors
not included.

If you've never seen scissors in your life, don't worry, you can also use this
tool to win at Words With Friends.
